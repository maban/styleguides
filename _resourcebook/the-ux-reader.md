At MailChimp, we love to show our work - in part because it helps us get better at what we do. This book is a collection of the most popular articles from our UX Newsletter, along with some content exclusive to the book. It's the embodiment of our quest to reflect, refine, and grow. We made it in hopes it’ll help you do the same.
