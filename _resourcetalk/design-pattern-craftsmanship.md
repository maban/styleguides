My first Design Pattern Craftsmanship talk in 2012 was presented at Etsy's Code as Craft series and I talked about MailChimp's original UI Pattern Library. Since then, we've redesigned and rebuilt our pattern library, so V2 of the talk covers the history, challenges, and benefits of our exploration of front-end patterns.
